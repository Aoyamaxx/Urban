Anton Schlepers, discoverer of Park De Oeverlanden, Amsterdam.

In 1981, he and partner Henk Gerritsen founded the association De Oeverlanden Blijven! to save the northern riparian lands of the Nieuwe Meer in Amsterdam from municipal building plans, which succeeded in 1985. Historic land in the context of the gay emancipation movement. From far away from the times when gays were still banished to garbage dumps beyond the Pesthuizen. Rather lost than rich! That dump was Parkland De Oeverlanden.

Recreationists now (not queer) are not reminded on Parklandschap De Oeverlanden that gays have turned the encroaching city here with activism on this spot beyond the Pesthuizen, on the dump De Oeverlanden.
Recreationists now (not queer), are eager to use this straight friendly enclave. By putting a fence around the gay cruise spot with Scottish Highlanders (and their flaxes), it was thought to achieve this. However the gay cruise spot has now gained its own bike paths in its enclave!
Anton Schlepers, the hero of Park the Oeverlanden, the gay, on the street signs there the discoverer. Euphemistically. Again the city advances, with plans for Park Landscape De Oeverlanden, at odds with the spirit of Anton Schlepers.",0.9433,,,,,,,,3.8,19.5,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.29

I've been there during the day, but at night, if it's not a remake of Freddy... I think it can do a bit. Be careful kheys. Enjoys your trip. Moi j'ai kiffé",0.9766,,,,,,,,7.1,4.9,1.2,7.5,12.0,4.0,0.29

It's a nice place to take a walk around the lake. Can take up to 1 hour for a complete round walk.

Spacious park, with green spots, old Amsterdam woods. Places that allow public barbecue. Clean up needed, if not cleaned up it can result in heavy fines.

Also a nice beach for a small amount people.
Check always for blauwe algen, it’s a bacteria in the water , which can cause big harm to dogs and human.
If you see warning signs, do not enter the water.

Boat rent available.

Shopping street west of the lake.

Hotels close to the lake as well available.

Dogs allowed (it's a public place), haven't seen dogs swimming, though; I guess because there is no easy way for them to go out of the water (there's no shore it's a pier). Only some occasional seaweed and very little waste in the water. Depending on the time there might not be any shadows to cover yourself from the sun!

If you walk a little further (10 minutes) from streetcar 12 sloterpark into the park, you come to a quieter area.
Here you can lie right by the water, it's very quiet apart from the airplanes (which you can hear everywhere in Amsterdam) and you can be by yourself.
The water can be reached via a ladder and you can swim wonderfully!
It is also very clean and barbecuing is also possible.

If you're lucky, you'll hear the ice cream man and can refresh yourself when he passes by!

Sloterplas Beach,413,2018-11-29,Sloterplas,unofficial,52.3720176,4.822453,It seemed clean. Funny thing about the beach restaurant. I ordered 2 fries. Instead of 2 I got 1. Something must have gone wrong. But now comes the...... he took an empty container and divided the fries of container 1 over 2 containers... well creatively still 2 containers of fries but 3 half. Still a waste of money. Had dr but nothing to say because who invents this has something of a twist. So it was sad.to well 2 hungry children.    Wel superfijn that at this beach free bands are given away by the municipality. There is much ge bbq what is not allowed here. Find it annoying if you are with your kids weggegrookt by such a thing. No control unfortunately. Also at the water is no control. Well you will think you have to watch out as a parent. Yet I see many little ones of 1.5 to 2 years wandering around alone because mom is too busy with friends ... but that's not my business.   Beach is just right. Quiet. No strange gear. Really a family beach.    Easy to reach and blue zone parking. Fine hear.   Would bring your own food and drinks.

Beverage menu could really be better idd. Fine not to serve soft drinks, but make sure you have a wider range of fresh juices and good special beer (la Chouffe, Texels...). You only have gravy from packaging and I find that totally crooked again. In the end I ordered a blond beer and it turned out to be Gulpener. The only beer I really don't like.

-------

Dear owner, in response to your comment. You always react a bit prickly to feedback unfortunately. I give you 4 stars and also reported that your opportunity has huge potential. It's a cool place, with cool decor and atmosphere. Apparently you can't handle feedback very well. The specific story below...

When I asked for something like cassis on the terrace, I was informed that you don't have soda! That first of all. When I asked about beer, I was given a vague abstract of your apparently great offerings. There was a blonde beer so thought I'd take that.

Furthermore, half of your customers are sitting down to work and inside you hear (pretty loud but okay), 70's music in the case and hip-hop from the kitchen, mixed together. Are we allowed to think anything about that?

I would say, make a little clearer choices in what you want to be, make sure your staff knows the offerings well or make a nice drink menu and take feedback a little less prickly. Then you can see me back often in the future, at least when somewhat well-meaning critical guests are welcome.",0.9892,,,,,,,,1.7,16.6,4.0,0.0,-0.1,2.0,0.14

Dinner-1 person- September 3. 2022 Saturday

@Impression
very enchanting environment, fine cooking, creative and well designed vegan menu, BUT very disappointed on service

@What was ordered
-4€       Bread with Olive Oil, starter
-18€     Ravioli in seaweed butter,main dish
-2€       Glass of sparkling water
-6,5€    Glass of IPA from tap
-33€     In total for 1 person with tips

@Sum it up
Looking forward to enjoying the whole sustainable and local economy oriented dining experience, I found the service and attitude offered by the staff somewhat disappointing.

@Greeting
Personally greeted and accompanied to my seats upon arrival, the beginning was very pleasant. But the service only went downhill after that.

@Unaware ordering
Before I was even reaching my chair, my waiter offered me bread and olive oil, without explaining that this would charge 4€ on the menu. Being used to house-served free bread and olive oil in most restaurants in Germany, Austria, France and Italy, just to name a few countries in Europe, I didn’t hesitate and said yes please. I only realized my order without being aware of it after I had time to actually look at the menu.The bread came however quite quickly so I decided to overlook this quite frankly trickery-move from my waiter and went further with main dish ordering.

@Actual ordering
He did a good job in taking the actual orders, but didn’t notice that I barely touched the bread. The fact was I didn’t like the powdered dip and wanted some salt with my olive oil instead. But since no one asked once how I liked it, I was a bit offended so I barely touch it and asked for it to be packed in a paper bag. Yet no one even bothers to think about or care about why.
Later I was also fighting with my main dish as I suddenly felt not so well, of course I think it’s not their fault that I felt sick, but even though I shared with my waiter when he came to take my plate away, that I wasn’t feeling so great, he didn’t respond at all and just left with my leftover. The sustainable way would be asking if there’s anything wrong with it or if I would like to have it packed it up with my bread.

@Contradicting concept & service quality
Yes it was Saturday night, and I could see they are fully booked and very busy. But for a business that openly talks about beliefs in quality dining, sustainability and the awareness of the damages food industries bring to our planet, being busy shouldn’t become an issue.
The service staff pushed customers to order and didn‘t really bother with the perception of their food. As a result there was food waste and I am sure this happens to other customers too. Hopefully only when they are super busy.

However the food was a bit disappointing and being an expensive restaurant made it even more disappinting.  The dishes were very interesting with unusual great ideas, some were really tasty, like ravioli with poppy seed, dill and hazelnut topping. But many of the flavors were really unbalanced. That ravioli had way too much balsamic vinegar and the filling was potato which in my opinion not great with pasta. And it was 17 euros. The pom pom dish (a deep fried musroom) could have been great bc of the unusual type of mushroom used, but it was way too oily. It was served with red cabbage which tasted more of cloves than cabbage. The sauce thoguh was really well made. And I also liked the chocolat pasta. One more thing: we got a hot apple juice with 30% alcohol which was merely hot and didnt taste like alcohol at all.

The place could've been in Spain or someother part of the world. I felt nostalgic for places I've not been to. :) If ever vegan restaurant was made to be this hip, we'd have less people eating meat I think. There are more than few example I can give that other restaurant can take from books of 'De Ceuvel'.

Example 1 : gracious selection of food, won't fall away from sensory pleasures you are used to. While still eating vegan food. Crispy pom pom blanc. Chocolate pasta.

Example 2 : Cocktail selection was magnificent, it was just intriguing to just try all of them. Apple sauce drink was amazing !

So why I still gave one star is because half of (Jemezz app) our order didn't make it to their system. Once they checked our bank transaction and accepted the order.
Next time I just gave up and threw the shrodingers cat philosophy for my drink . And the cat was indeed not in the box. :(",0.9781,,,,,,,,5.9,4.9,9.9,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.14

Supernice on a summer night. Mega terrace these days. Slightly more massive so, but still very nice. And best of all, everything on the menu is vegan. Very tasty and that mezze plate looks super good too. Rich in flavors.

They also have a little store there inside, with some food items and nicely displayed herbs and spices. Picked up a funny 'carnivorous' plant there.

There wasn't a menu and the staff told me they don't normally serve food on a Wednesday.  But she asked if the cook could make me something and yes.... he could. Perfect cuisine service and it was delicious too.",0.9493,,,,,,,,2.2,4.1,2.4,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.14

De Ceuvel,1973,2019-07-26,De Ceuvel,unofficial,52.3922115,4.9037356,"De Ceuvel is a restaurant on a mission: the menu carefully articulates there is a wider vision to deliver an eco-friendly and low environmental impact. There is a rough and ready feel; a reflection on the increasing trend towards sustainability and authenticity at the expense perhaps of luxury and, perhaps, the basic proposition.
So with very high praise and reviews, we came here for lunch.
Both the inside and outside decor give the feeling of an American style summer camp assembled by a shipwrecked crew with nothing to make shelter with other than washes ashore in the island with its mismatched tables and seating, home-made decorations and deliberately contrasting use of panel colour.
If a small group of dreadlocked hippies revealed themselves slouched onto patchwork beanbags wielding archaic musical instruments and lamenting the tax dodging and well-heeled patriarchy: I would have asked them where I could purchase the nearest fair trade, organically grown cold brew.
So we find ourselves at a school desk ordering from a concise lunch menu during a semi busy Saturday service. Oh, and it’s vegan bang in trend with most restaurants I went to in two weeks of grazing around Amsterdam.
Much like the decor, the food was a bit cobbled together and didn’t make much sense. Our oyster mushroom croquette with mustard greens over sourdough (it’s an open face sandwich) was less croquette and more suppli sized mushroom flavoured dough with a crust. It is a ‘croquette’ in the style of the local Dutch bitternballen which would work if it was the same size - the texture would make the dish better but not take it over the line. The open face sandwich proposition is pointless. This dish would be better conceptualised as a starter oyster mushroom bittenballen with a dip.
The cheesy padron pepper toastie is gooey and cheesy but doesn’t rise above the level of a home comfort sandwich regardless of the padron peppers.
Vegan food is a hard sell for many people and there are restaurants that are fighting to change paradigms and perceptions about vegan food making it exciting, winning hearts and minds.
This is not that place. There’s a lot here with a good location and the shabby chic is on trend but the core proposition of paying for food for enjoyment collapses.",0.9809,,,,,,,,5.1,26.9,11.7,0.7,2.3,2.0,0.14

Formerly an abandoned shipyard, the site has been converted into a place to live and work.

Everything here has been built, assembled and imagined from recycled materials.
The bar, teeming with life both inside and out, the waterfront, with pontoons and floating terraces. Everywhere, refurbished and salvaged old houseboats have been placed on the polluted ground, and we move between them on raised walkways to make way for carefully selected plants that patiently carry out the work of decontamination. A host of companies have colonized these spaces, all involved in the arts or sciences related to ecology.
